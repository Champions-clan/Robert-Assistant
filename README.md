### Robert
The main heart of the project and the bascially it do the everything say to him you can give him commands as commander by pressing a hotkey which is shift+tab+7 or by right clicking on this icon in the system tray as shown here and selecting the **Robert Listner**:-

So let me tell you all the things it can do or the things you can do by speaking are wikipedia, open youtube, open google (I know this one is funny but what goes to add it and it funny to mention it 😅), open gmail,show weather,tell time,tell day,tell date, who are you, who made you, open stackoverflow, news, open cmd, open calculator,do search,take screenshot, play music, open notepad and THE POWER MODE (It is a simple thing you can ask the robert any scientific question 😋).

### Task Manger
So here comes the guis. They have very good things and we thought why not give you guys a task manger like if you forgot that today is your's mom's or her's 😉 birthday eh leave it like you miss a task or your angry boss gave you alot of task and your lazy brain can't handle them then just write them down so you don't forget the task and you don't get fired from the company (I have done research there is less chances to get fired by fogeting the task 🤣). And you can edit the task name, description and it's priority.

### ALarm
The name is self-explanatory, If your little brain can't understand what it is so it is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN916IN916&ei=oF8WYIHaA8LFz7sPzfeGuAE&q=alarm+meaning&oq=alarm+meaning&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICAAQsQMQkQIyBQgAEJECMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEc6BwgAELEDEEM6BQgAELEDUIIMWKgXYI8ZaABwAngCgAGuAogB6wqSAQcwLjYuMS4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiBqoCl1sXuAhXC4nMBHc27ARcQ4dUDCA0&uact=5" target="_blank">alarm</a>. And you can set the alarm up give it the timming when to ring the alarm and when alarm matches the time you sets , It will give you notification and will ring a beep sound, So you never forget to do the work on time.

### Translation
As straight out of the word as it sounds. You might often face some foreign or new words that you have never met before. So here it is your translator (I know that there is a thing called google translation but as you readed we are carzy so we also added it so it can funny project 😁).

### **CODE SNIPPET**
Here is your most useful thing!, So honestly tell me how many times you ever serach for a code which have some lines of code or a project on github in which you have used a module and you can't remember what module was it and how you used it (I know everyone have done this in there life if you didn't then you are noob!) ,So this is the best thing for this type of situation it will store the code in the database and which you can just sync or make gitlist for it so you can never lost the code. It is easy to open the code snippet thing right click on that icon in the system tray that I have mentioned earlier and choose the **Home Page** or press shift+tab+6 and you will get the code snippet gui button in the fornt from there you can access the code snippet gui and there you can select the files of any langauge and later on you can sort them, name the code snippet and to just access the code just press on the code's name and it will be copied to your clipborad and then you can just past it and do whatever you want!
If you didn't understood then see this :-

Keep in mind that it is a background script so see your taskbar there you will find the icon in the system tray and in first the gui will open after closing the gui you can give commands to the robert but to give the roberts command again just use the hotkey shift+tab+7 or that icon in the system tray and to open the gui just right click on the icon in the system tray or press the hotkey shift+tab+6.
